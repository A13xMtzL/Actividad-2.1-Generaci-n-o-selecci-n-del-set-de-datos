# Lego Data Augmentation

This repository contains the code for a data augmentation process applied to a dataset of Lego images. The code was developed in Visual Studio Code, and it's contained in the Jupyter notebook file `Lego_Data_augmentation.ipynb`.

## Dataset

The original dataset used in this code is not included in this repository due to its size. However, you can access the dataset from this [Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Ue-ZbK7UUYzEtVTQOHjzfBG0p6RI8nik?usp=sharing). 

## Running the Code

You can run the code in the Jupyter notebook using any Python environment that supports Jupyter notebooks. If you want to run the code in Google Colab, you can uncomment the two lines at the beginning of the notebook that mount your Google Drive to the Colab environment and change the directory to the path of your drive. Make sure to change the path to the location where you have stored the dataset.
