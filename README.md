- **Applied Preprocessing:** The images are provided in their original format, without specific preprocessing. However, users can apply their own preprocessing techniques as needed.

## Dataset

The original dataset used in this code is not included in this repository due to its size. However, you can access the modified dataset from this [Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Ue-ZbK7UUYzEtVTQOHjzfBG0p6RI8nik?usp=sharing). 

The dataset is divided into two folders: `train` and `test`. 
The `train` folder contains **4,461** images, while the `test` folder contains **1,918** images. Each image is labeled with the corresponding LEGO brick class.


## Running the Code

You can run the code in the Jupyter notebook using any Python environment that supports Jupyter notebooks. If you want to run the code in Google Colab, you can uncomment the two lines at the beginning of the notebook that mount your Google Drive to the Colab environment and change the directory to the path of your drive. Make sure to change the path to the location where you have stored the dataset.
